# calendar
A calendar which is divided by math-related logic

## Weeks
We have six days per week, without special names. 
But we need some culture-neutral names for them so that people can easily refer to them.
People would rest on 5th and 6th day of each week, and work from 1st to 4th.

## Months
All months have equal days, 30, no more and no less. Each month would have 5 weeks as explained above.
Names are just samples and do not represent current gregorian calendar which is used by humans on earth.

The months “Natura” and “Tectum” are bonus and no one has to work on them, but essential workers like medical staff and firefighters should get paid. 
They will be paid 1 full week (1/6 of monthly payment) as a gift, tax-free. The gift should not be mentioned in their annual salary or as their prize.
Natura and Tectum are here as a padding for us to start the next season's months on the exact day after Summer Solstice or Autumn Equinox.

## Leap day
A full loop around the sun takes 365.242190 days, so we need to add 1 day as leap day. 
Earth is slowing millennia by millennia, so the calculation of the leap day can be different for future humans or martians who are gonna use this.
We just add the day to our vacation months until is becomes trivial for a century-long. If we add it to Tectum, it works a a padding day for us to start October on Automn Equinox, not sooner.
